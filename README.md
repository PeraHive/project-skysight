# Sky Sight

This project focuses on developing an intelligent drone platform that integrates computer vision with autonomous flight control. The drone is equipped with an onboard camera system that continuously captures real-time video data, which is processed using vision algorithms to detect paths, obstacles, and objects of interest.
